    <p>
      Children/Teen's one day meditation courses are exclusively for children
      and teens between the ages of 8 to 17. Children interested in a course
      must read the code of conduct and timetable below very carefully and
      complete the required medical emergency form and application form. Parents
      must complete the permission form and return it with your application.
      After we receive your completed application and permission forms, accepted
      students will receive a letter of welcome to attend the course.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a children's course, you will learn how to practice Anapana
      meditation - awareness of respiration - along with the five "promises" or
      precepts. These courses have been specifically designed for children. You
      will have the chance to practice Anapana meditation with guided
      instructions in the meditation hall for periods of up to 30 minutes. These
      sessions are mixed with story and discussion sessions, break periods and
      games and art activities throughout the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the words of some children who have completed similar meditation
      courses at other Vipassana centers around the world:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I learned that I like meditating because it makes me feel relaxed."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I like this course because I like playing outside, playing with clay.
        We also did tie-dye. I also like this course because it seems like Iâ€™m
        at home and the food is so good"
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "At school if I need to concentrate on what the teacher is doing or
        saying I can use Anapana. And if I am mad and angry I can use Anapana."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I think meditation is very important in this busy world because it
        helps us to maintain a stable state of our mind and also it helps us to
        do our work with right understanding."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Adults who have completed a ten-day course can apply to volunteer during
      the children's and teens' courses. Help is needed in the kitchen, as well
      as with leading activities for the children.
