      The children’s/teen course offers young people between the ages
      of 8 and 17 an introduction to Anapana
      meditation, which is a practice of the observation of natural breath to
      concentrate the mind. They will learn to practice Anapana and begin to
      take their first steps on the path of Dhamma. The entire path of Dhamma,
      rediscovered and taught by Gotama the Buddha more than 2500 years ago,
      is a universal remedy for universal problems and has nothing to do with
      any organized religion or sectarian tradition. For this reason, it can
      be practiced freely by all, in any place, at any time. Its practice does
      not conflict with any race, community or religion and will prove equally
      beneficial to one and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young people who have started practicing Anapana have realized many
      benefits. Their ability to concentrate becomes enhanced, their memory
      gets sharper, their ability to comprehend a subject improves and they
      become calmer. In general, they feel they have a practical tool to use
      in the face of any type of adversity or challenge.
    </p>

      During the course, there will be meditation instructions as well as
      other activities such as games, art, and storytelling. The children will
      be divided into groups according to their age for many activities. They
      will be assigned group leaders who will personally accompany and assist
      them throughout the course, providing support and guidance as needed.
    </p>

      The intent of the children’s/teen course is serious. It is not
      appropriate for children/teens who are unable to follow directions or to
      participate in organized, self-modulating activities. It is also not
      appropriate for children/teens who are unable to understand the meaning
      or purpose of the daily schedule and Code of Conduct. Students attending
      the course will be asked to maintain silence for extended periods of
      time. Segregation of the sexes will be maintained at all times in the
      accommodations as well as in the meditation hall and during much of the
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not mandatory that a parent or guardian accompanies your
      child/teen to the course. For a residential course: Parents or guardians
      who are students of Goenkaji or his assistant teachers are welcome to
      stay at the center and participate in work projects. Since parents or
      guardians will not be participating in the course, they will follow a
      separate schedule. They will also be accommodated separately from the
      children/teens. Only those children/teens who feel comfortable staying
      in separate accommodations from their parents are encouraged to attend.
      We ask that parents and affiliated adults refrain from communicating
      with or contacting their children/teens throughout the course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parents or guardians who have not completed a ten-day course with
      Goenkaji or his assistant teachers are welcome to stay with their
      children/teens during registration, but should then leave the center
      until the course is over. There are numerous hotels, motels and
      campsites in the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a one-day offsite course, parents or guardians are asked to leave the
      course site after registration and orientation is over and come back at
      the end of the course. Before applying for the course, please make sure
        that both you and your child have read and understood the <a href="#code-of-conduct"> Code of
        Conduct</a> and <a href="#sample-timetable">Sample Timetable</a>.
