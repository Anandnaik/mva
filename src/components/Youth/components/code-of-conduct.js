      Learning to practice Anapana meditation is very valuable because it
      helps you to become a better person. Practicing Anapana meditation will
      help you to train your mind to become concentrated and calm. This will
      make your mind strong so that you will be able to avoid doing or saying
      things that are hurtful or harmful to yourself and to others. This
      strength of mind will help you to feel happier and more peaceful.
      Practicing Anapana and learning to concentrate will help you to become
      the master of your mind.

    <p>
      To help you succeed in practicing Anapana meditation it is important
      that you do your best to follow the instructions that you will be given
      during the course. While you are at the course, it is also important
      that you agree to follow the Code of Conduct written below. In the same
      way that a house needs a good foundation to support it, so the practice
      of Anapana needs a good foundation. This good foundation for Anapana is
      built by following the Code of Conduct. It will help you to avoid
      performing actions that are harmful or hurtful to yourself and others.

      During the first meditation session at the course you will be asked to
      repeat the following five vows or precepts. These are written in bold
      and underneath each is an explanation. Please read them carefully so
      that you will understand what you are saying when the time comes:
